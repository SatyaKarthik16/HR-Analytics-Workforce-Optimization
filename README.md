## 🔍 Problem Statement
Employee attrition, disengagement, and training inefficiencies pose challenges to HR teams. This project builds a robust data pipeline and dashboard to:
- Identify departments with high attrition risk
- Correlate engagement with performance and tenure
- Optimize training investment by employee segmentation

- **Visualization:** Power BI / Tableau
- **Libraries:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Data:** Synthetic HR dataset (10,000+ records)

---

## 📈 Key Results
- Discovered that attrition was highest in Sales and IT
- Found strong correlation between performance score and engagement levels
- Identified low training hours among those who exited early
- Generated segmentation clusters for targeted upskilling

---

## ✅ Insights Summary

- Departments like **Sales** and **IT** show higher attrition.
- **Engagement score** increases with better **performance scores**.
- Employees with **lower training hours** tend to have a higher likelihood of attrition.
- These KPIs (attrition %, avg training, engagement) offer **clear targets** for workforce optimization strategies.
